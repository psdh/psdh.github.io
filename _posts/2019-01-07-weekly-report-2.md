Heya!

This past week was a lot of fun. A lot happened, was able to get quite a few things done. Here is some quick sprint-retro style summary:

### What went well?
- Got my running and strength workouts in
- My first episode on the Early twenties podcast
- Got started with Meditation

### What didn't go well?
- Couldn't progress on my reading goals
- Got only 2 meditation sessions in
- Had a sore throat and had to take a day off :( :( :(

Yep, that's pretty much it on a high level. The third episode of the Early twenties podcast is out now. We spend quite some time discussing about executing on our resolutions / goals.

As mentioned last week, I will share my 2019 goals now. I wanted to ponder more on them, but I know I'm trying to procrastinate. Not this time! Here they are:

* Personal
    * Document my life more
        * IG, sodhi.xyz, journals
    * get your blog running
        * Plan to put out regular weekly updates and atleast 1 relevant post a month
    * Have 4 30 mornings
        * This is going to take long, looking forward to it
    * Read atleast 12 books this year
        * This includes summarizing and documents my opinions/learnings on the blog
    * Run a marathon
    * Run a triathlon
* Career
    * Learn new tech
        * I haven't figured out a way to make this measurable yet. I'd also rather change this to a system/habit kind of target. (Dont know what I&quot;m talking about? listen to the [podcast](https://anchor.fm/earlytwenties)!
    * Create a side income source however small
* Relationships
    * Just want to mention that I have some goals. Not going into any details :)

I don't know if you can make out from my writing but I'm really excited about this year and the way things are going for me right now!!

Before this becomes ultra long, I'll jump to things that I read/heard this week and found valuable.

### Things I read/heard 

1. David 'Merry christmas' Goggins is amazing. Heard his Joe rogan and rich roll podcast. Highly recommended.
2. Last week I realized that I don't try to learn from history at all. Started listening to the [Hardcore history podcast](https://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/). Don't know if that'll help directly but I'm 40 minutes in and it's def very very fun :D.
(a more detailed review next week maybe, also, the episode I started is 4.5+ hours ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±)
3. https://guzey.com/personal/what-should-you-do-with-your-life/
https://80000hours.org/career-guide/how-to-be-successful/
https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2PaeRjVqAN7MngxTXFPQkpLVjg/view
Found all of them incredibly valuable
4. I read the quote: `Writing is thinking` somewhere and it really stuck with me. It makes complete sense, I feel I think more about my week during this report (and my journaling sessions) than the rest of the week.
This also reminds me why folks at Amazon used to value writing press release and FAQ (ah PRFAQs) for a product before they started working on it.

Ah! this was fun. Hope you had some too :)

See you next time
