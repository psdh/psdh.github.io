Yo Yo Yo!

Another quick week!

### What went well?
* Increased run mileage to around 38 Kms
	* total stress score is (TBD)
* Increased total working out time last week to 8 hours
* Started my 2-3 days of vegan'ism. Plan to do complete 2-3 month vegan prep. Would judge improvement after that
* Gargi was visiting London (she is working in Paris now). Weekend was very social and fun! Went to dishoom after a looong time!
* cleaned my home up a bit, big big improvement!

### What didn't go well?
* While the weekend was fun, it could have been more productive from a work standpoint.
* I've been trying to sleep less, which has lead to an irregular sleeping schedule. This is impacting my work at times :(
* Didn't do enough strength sessions.


### Things i'm excited about 
* Machine learning project at work!
* Some studying that I'm doing on my own time
* Booked my tickets for Mumbai marathon. Excited for this! Have to ramp up marathon prep!

	* Monday: 1 hour running (Z2) + strength work
    * Tuesday: cycle commute + swimming session + swimmming lessons
    * Wednesday: cycle commute + 1 hour running (<=Z2) + stretching work
