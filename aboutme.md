My name is Prabhjyot Singh Sodhi

I'm primarily a Software Developer and a Runner. 

On this blog, I post weekly updates on where I am and what I am doing. (I'm not adding any more plans, because: http://www.itssarahrexford.com/blog//casey-neistat-action-and-intent)

I'm really big on personal improvement and growth so if you want to discuss anything, please hit me up on those little icons below!

See you around! :D
