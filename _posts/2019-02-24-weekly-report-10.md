	* have to make better use of my hours there 
    * taking the c++ book to work tomorrow
    * think about working on the interfaces?
* workout was golden: got in a speed interval workout: 1K x 4 : 4:39 being the last and fastest pace!!!
	* apart from that also got in a restorative yoga session
* got chinese for dinner so that's not super good I guess


Random Notes:
