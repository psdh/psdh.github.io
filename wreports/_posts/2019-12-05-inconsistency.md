I haven't written a report in 2-3 weeks now.

start again.


Workout schedule for the rest of the week: (Mileage done by Wednesday: 15.6Km)
* Thursday: 90 minutes easy + stretching (maybe extend to 2 hours) (12kms +)
	* did 70 minutes easy, then did a walk run for 40 minutes (4 kms) while eating a kebab
    * No stretching
    
* Friday: 30 minute easy + gym (morning) + 60 minutes easy in the evening (12 kms)
* Saturday: 15m WU, 5k Parkrun, 15m CD (9K)
* Sunday: 90 + 60 ? (don't konw) (if I get 20Kms then, then I'd end the week at 68 kms, which is where I'd like to be :)
