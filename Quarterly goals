## Think about things that you're interested in and how you can make money out of it

## Keep reading books, you have to read, you have to learn and you have to remember what you learn so make sure you document what you learn, so that you can continue reading and re-learning the lessons from a book!

## Run the marathon, make sure you have the momentum, put in proper training and it'll happen for you!
