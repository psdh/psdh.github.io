Welcome to my website. I've known for a long time
that I should be documenting my life but didn't really make any
progress on that front.
Starting this week, I'll publish weekly reports talking about my
work, personal targets, projects and everything in between.

At work, this last week has been quite a relaxed week with everyone around
being in a vacation mode. I don't think I made good use of this 
opportunity by focusing without any distractions of meetings et
cetera. On the bright side, I think I'm pretty refreshed now and
filled up tremendous excitement and optimism for the coming year.

I'm still recovering from my knee injury so my running has been at
a standstill for the entire week. Having said that I got in a short
2-mile run in, just minutes before writing this post.

In the last couple of weeks, Shubhu, Gyani and I have started our
own podcasts about our early twenties and to share our journeys.
The second episode came out yesterday. Give it a listen:

I'm still in the process of drafting my goals for the year. I plan 
to share my goals in the next report. I also plan on having a proper
format for these weekly reports in the future.
I'm trying to get rid of my analysis paralysis, so bear with me
and I shall improve in the future reports.

*Learnings this week*

[Tim feriss' podcast with Stripe's founder Patrick ](https://tim.blog/2018/12/20/patrick-collison/)
A key takeway from this podcast for me was that I should be spending more
time reading history, understanding what we did in the past and learn
from that. I also think that I should spend time understanding the 
success of the top startups/companies today and don't think that
I'm doing enough of that.

In a more general sense, I think this podcast was a really good one and
that I should follow [Patrick](https://patrickcollison.com/) more
closely. 

Thanks for reading and Have a fun and exciting year 2019! :D
