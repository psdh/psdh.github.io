Yo Yo Yo!

Another week!...

Uhh, its 1245 and I'm starting to write this now :(
Well, Summary!

## What went well?
* The Early Twenties Podcast: 
	* I personally loved recording the most recent episode. It was with Ramsri Goutham and we spoke about his journey from a cushy silicon valley job to moving to India to open his own company. I think I learnt a few things from him and his story.
* Workouts!
	* This was a *great* week for my workouts. I did 29.68K this week with a crazy 17K long run!
    * I did miss a yoga workout on Sunday but it was the only missed workout and all in all I think I did great!
    * Plan to use this momentum going for the coming week!
* 

Uhh :(

I'm finding it too difficult to concentrate right now and I think trying to finish this right now will lead to a sleepy tomorrow.
I'll continue typing this tommorow!

Lots to write and think about :)
btw, I'm getting a cycle!
Excited :DD 
More on this tomorrow




P.S.: random notes during the week

Planning this week's workout schedule!

Monday Rating: 8
* Office was sleepy
	* have to make better use of my hours there 
    * taking the c++ book to work tomorrow
    * think about working on the interfaces?
* workout was golden: got in a speed interval workout: 1K x 4 : 4:39 being the last and fastest pace!!!
	* apart from that also got in a restorative yoga session
