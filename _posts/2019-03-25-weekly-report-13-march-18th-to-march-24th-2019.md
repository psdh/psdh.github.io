Have to make it clear to myself that this is going to be super small.

I almost feel that I won't be doing justice to this report if I write it now. But then, maybe that's trying to excuse myself. Trying to think that I've more important things to do than to follow protocol, be disciplined. 
I guess, that might sum up my last few weeks. 

Enough blabber

Summary!
## What went well?
* Workouts:
	* I still only did 13K in weekly running mileage but worked out 5 days which is somewhat getting back on track.
    * I think I'll have to give my body more time to get used to the cycling load and still do my running with the strength I used to have until a few weeks from now.
    * As mentioned earlier, a close friend is in town and it's going to be really challenging to keep up with my workouts but I **HAVE** to do it
* Work
	* Had an exciting week at work with a job fair going on and with all the interaction I did with a variety of teams. I think my appreciation for the company grew a lot. There are a ton of interesting problems.
* Reading
	* I ordered another book and read a bit of it: The guide to a good life by someone...
    * Not a big win, but a start. Have to appreciate starts
* Audiobook
	* I'm listening to https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/The-Ultimate-Jim-Rohn-Library-Audiobook/B076PRHZSD
    * and it's AMAZIIINNNG!
    * Jim rohn is so funny and inspiring at the same time. #RIP

More blabbering!
Meta:
I cry
I cry a lot
I criticize myself
With this report, I give myself another opportunity to cry, about what I didn't do, what I couldn't get, what I'm bad 
Having said that, I need this (atleast some of it) and have to modify this report to help me more and to bring out things that I did well
/Meta

## What didn't go well?
* Workouts
	* Currently working without a set goal in mind. Was going to run a HM on the 30th, but cancelled that since my friend was visiting.
    * Now I feel, 'if you argue for your limitations, you get to keep them'. I argued that I couldn't do that race since my friend is visiting and I wouldn't have the time and I don't get to run the race now.
    * Long way to go. Thinking of moving my workouts to the morning, before my legs get tired of the 15K commute cycling that i do each day.
* No progress on personal projects
	* Got another 3-4 ideas that I think are worth working on, atleast on the side
    * Had started working on a ideas page on the blog (copied from gyani's blog)
    * should get back to it and get it out in the public
	* I don't plan to make much progress on this front for another week tbh
    
## What I'm looking forward to?
* Workouts!
	* Always look forward to these!
    * this week is challenging
* The Early Twenties Podcast
	* super interesting podcast released with Dr Shamoly Khera, TV presenter, Motivational speaker and cosmetologist.
    * Listen to it! NOW! http://earlytwenties.co
* Work
	* We have a 3 day project and it seems pretty interesting!
