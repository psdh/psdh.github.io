Welcome back to another one of my weekly reports.

Jumping straight to the summary. Too distracted to talk about something else.

# What went well?
* Workouts
    * Well, sort of. I was able to get 4 workouts in. Missed the Sunday long run as I was in Paris. 
    * Counting this as good as I was able to get the Long run in today (12K, Loved it <3) 
* Paris trip
    * This was an amazing and welcome change from my everyday. Esp, given the fact that my last 3-4 weeks have been really hectic and I don't see that changing anytime soon.
    * Don't misunderstand me, I love my weeks right now. My best days are busiest days.
* The Early Twenties Podcast
    * This stuff gets more and more exciting every day. Having said, I still don't think I'm doing the best job actively thinking about this.
    
    * This week we almost didn't get an episode out. I would have hated it, but sometimes situations are difficult. Anyway, I love that we were able to make it work. The link will be embedded below for you to listen!
    

Side Note: Last week I had shared my weekly report on Facebook. This was the first time I was publicising these reports. I got some feedback regarding perhaps removing goals that I'm currently not able to get to and focusing more on a few things at a time. The benefits being less stress. Maybe this works for some people, but I'm just too afraid of forgetting about that goal of mine. I'd rather have the same things on my "What didn't go well" list each week than removing it from that list and forgetting it for 6 months.

# What didn't go well?
* Meditation | Mental Health workouts
    * Shubhu mentioned on a [recent podcast](https://earlytwenties.co/2019-02-03-episode-7/) that we think so much about our physical workouts but think so little about our mental workouts. I don't know about other people, but its super true for me and I want to actively focus on that. I just finished the [Joe Rogan podcast with Sam Hariss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA106wrMUe4) and they mention how physical workouts wasn't a thing 100 years back and now it's considered almost a mandate to do some sort of physical exercise. Have to get these in.
    * I had thought about investing some time at work for these. But haven't been able to do that yet.
* Active thinking
    * I don't have a better word for it, but I wish to invest more time to think about what am I doing and what would be the best way to do a certain thing.
    * I probably think about this process a bit. Since last week, I've started documenting a rating (out of 10) for the day. I'm currently rating how do I feel about the day.
* No Reading

# What do I look forward to?
* Workouts!!
    * They are probably the thing I look forward to most to. Everyday!
    * I just ran a 12K from work. I'd really love to explore running as a way to commute. It's def not faster than the tube or something, but if I'm anyway planning to run >6.5K, then it makes sense to do that as part of my commute.
     * Have to work on my running posture, I think that it can result in massive gains on speed!
* The Early Twenties Podcast
    * It's my turn to play host. I'm thinking of experimenting with a small episode, perhaps with parts or simply two 25-30 minute episodes on separate topics or something like that.
* Work
    * Monday was ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥. This is my last week with my team before I start training and it looks packed!
   
Here's the podcast!

# Learnings / Podcasts / Content-Consumed / Something that I'm thinking about
1. I learnt that I have no clue on how to discuss things with people who don't share my opinion. Tbf, this isn't something I learned this week, but still wanted to mention it here as a note to self.
This is difficult (at least for me) and it's really important for me to understand!

2. Making money via podcasts is still a big problem. This is something Joe Rogan and Sam harass discuss a lot in their [podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA106wrMUe4). There are conflicting ideas about how the future looks in this space. Should think about innovating something in this space. It's clearly a problem.

2. Completed the[Susan Cain podcast with Tim feriss](https://tim.blog/2019/01/24/susan-cain/): 
It was really insightful into how at one point she was afraid of public speaking and now is actually making a living as a public speaker. They also talk about being shy vs being an introvert which is a really interesting idea for me.

2. a16z podcast: https://a16z.com/2018/12/24/how-internet-happened-evolution-of-tech/
a16z podcast: https://a16z.com/2018/12/29/talent-tech-trends-culture-ben-marc-tyler-cowen-summit-2018/ Heard a couple of podcasts from the a16z series. Didn't really like it tbh or maybe I was just too lost to understand things. Some ideas/topics were def interesting and I'd def give more episodes a chance.

4. [Joe Rogan Podcast with David Sinclair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOTS0HS7aq4): It was an amazing talk about our advances towards age longevity. Interesting and hilarious at the same time. Joe Rogan is amazing, really funny dude. 
    * Makes we want to think about what all should I consume if I want to care about the longevity for my life: https://podcastnotes.org/2019/01/30/sinclair/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOTS0HS7aq4
5. [Joe Rogan Podcast with drummer Travis Barker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf8aG4sK4XE) 
    This was another fun podcast. Travis Barker is a very popular drummer (among the 100 greatest drummers of all time). He has had some tragic experiences including a plane crash that he survived. Joe explores his journey through all of this, all the way from smuggling weed to Iraq to now being clean for 10+ years. He also doesn't fly anymore and has had his complete bodies tattooed. Interesting guy, interesting podcast!

6. During this week, I had posted on Facebook and Instagram asking for some podcast recommendations. I am yet to try any of them but have downloaded them and I'd review them probably next week. Couldn't get in a lot of podcasts this week due to my Paris trip.

One final piece before I say goodbye. In order to minimize the recency bias, I've started documenting my podcasts and day-rating each day instead of at the end of the week. Let's see how that goes.

Until next time
Keep killing it,

P.S. Caffeine does wonders with me, What about you? (comment below)
Random fact: [Daniel Pink says](https://www.danpink.com/pinkcast/pinkcast-2-15-this-is-when-you-should-drink-coffee/) that drink coffee around an hour or two after waking up and in the afternoon before an afternoon nap. It's got to do with the cortisol (it's a stress hormone) levels. I heard this first on the [Tim Ferriss podcast with Daniel Pink](https://tim.blog/2018/03/25/daniel-pink/) (it's also in his book called When). Ok bye now
